In this assignment, you will be performing a series of image processing tasks using DALL-E and the Python Imaging Library (PIL). You will generate a unique image, apply a rotation transformation, and perform a color inversion.

The steps are as follows:

Use DALL-E to generate a visually appealing image using the provided prompt. Save the image as `cool.png`.
Rotate the generated image by 45 degrees, demonstrating your understanding of basic transformations in image processing. Save the rotated image as `rotated_45_cool.png`.
Finally, invert the colors of the rotated image. This step will familiarize you with color space transformations. Save the final image as `final_cool.png`.
