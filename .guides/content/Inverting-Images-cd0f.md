Inverting an image involves reversing its color values, creating a "negative" of the original image. This can be useful for creating interesting visual effects, emphasizing specific features of an image, or generating additional variations of a generated image. We will explore image inversion using the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and the DALL-E 2 API.



```python
import os
import openai
import secret
from PIL import Image,ImageOps
from io import BytesIO
import requests

openai.api_key = secret.api_key

#Saving our base image
base_image=Image.open('base_img.jpg')
```

### Color Inversion

Color inversion involves reversing the RGB values of each pixel in the image. This can create a striking effect that highlights different aspects of the image compared to the original.


```python
# Invert the colors of the base image
inverted_image = ImageOps.invert(base_image)

# Save the inverted image to a file
inverted_image.save('inverted.jpg')
```

### Grayscale Inversion

Grayscale inversion involves first converting the image to grayscale and then reversing its color values. This creates a negative effect while preserving the tonal relationships in the image.

```python
# Convert the base image to grayscale
grayscale_image = ImageOps.grayscale(base_image)

# Invert the grayscale image
inverted_grayscale_image = ImageOps.invert(grayscale_image)

# Save the inverted grayscale image to a file
inverted_grayscale_image.save('inverted_grayscale.jpg')
```
{Try it!}(python3 Img_inverting.py 2)

### Inversion with Custom Color Channels 

You can also create custom effects by inverting only specific color channels of the image. For example, you can invert the red and green channels while preserving the blue channel.

```python
# Split the color channels of the base image
r, g, b = base_image.split()

# Invert the red and green channels
inverted_r = ImageOps.invert(r)
inverted_g = ImageOps.invert(g)

# Combine the inverted red and green channels with the original blue channel
inverted_custom_channels_image = Image.merge("RGB", (inverted_r, inverted_g, b))

# Save the custom channel inverted image to a file
inverted_custom_channels_image.save('inverted_custom_channels.jpg')
```

{Try it!}(python3 Img_inverting.py 3)
[Click here to refresh your inverted image](close_file inverted_custom_channels.jpg panel=1; open_file inverted_custom_channels.jpg panel=1) 


By applying various inversion techniques to images generated by the DALL-E 2 API, you can create unique and visually engaging images, adding variety and interest to your projects.
