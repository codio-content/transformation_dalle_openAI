In this assignment, you will be performing a series of image processing tasks using DALL-E and the Python Imaging Library (PIL). You will generate a unique image, apply a rotation transformation, and perform a color inversion.

The steps are as follows:

1. Use DALL-E to generate a visually appealing image using the provided prompt. Save the image as `cool.png`.

```
cool_prompt= "Reunion of man, team, squad with katanas, ninja ,background forest , abstract, full hd render + 3d octane render +4k UHD + immense detail + dramatic lighting + well lit + black, purple, blue, pink, cerulean, teal, metallic colours, + fine details + octane render + 8k"
```
2. Rotate the generated image by 45 degrees, demonstrating your understanding of basic transformations in image processing. Save the rotated image as `rotated_45_cool.png`.
3. Finally, invert the colors of the rotated image. This step will familiarize you with color space transformations. Save the final image as `final_cool.png`.
